# Spotify_Scrape
Welcome to my first web-scraping project I'm creating for my data science class!

I decided to look at the Billboard Top 100 playlist on Spotify and scrape the URI to access track information! Data in the music industry is super interesting especially as we move farther away from live recordings to digitally-produced creations. I wanted to analyze the musicality of the top trending songs (on Spotify) to see if there were any interesting trends!

Thankfully, python has a relatively lightweight library called "Spotipy" that helps give access to music data accessible from the spotify web api. To get an API key for this project, I linked my Spotify account to the Spotify Developers website and created an app on my dashboard. This provided me with a client id and a client secret, which I have excluded from this repository since they are private keys.
